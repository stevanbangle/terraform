<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Udemy now asks for your feedback very early on and I can appreciate it being hard to judge a course from only a few lectures. Best in-depth lectures start after 30% of the course. Some students are giving reviews after watching 10-15% of the course Please make sure your review is accurate and update it as you go along.</p><p>Compare our course with other terraform courses in udemy. We created a lengthy course not compromising on the quality. If you think this isn’t a 5-star course, please let me know and I’ll do whatever I can to improve it. I want the best possible experience for you, so message me with any issues. Thank you!</p>
